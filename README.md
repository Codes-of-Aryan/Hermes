# Hermes - Seamless Intermodal Travel Experience

## Overview

Hermes is a digital solution developed by FTE during the Cathay Hackathon 2023 to offer a unique travel experience beyond traditional flight and hotel stays by leveraging digital means to provide value-added services and enhancements. The aim of Hermes is to enable seamless intermodal travel within the Greater Bay Area (GBA), allowing customers to book and enjoy a personalized and hassle-free travel experience.

## Problem Statement

Cathay recognizes that personalized services often do not extend beyond their own customer experience ecosystem. Third-party providers hinder the ability to offer premium services within the intermodal travel services. Therefore, the pain point addressed by Hermes is to bridge this gap and provide a seamless intermodal travel experience through Cathay within the GBA.

## Features and Functionality

### Trigger-Response Contact System

Hermes incorporates a trigger-response contact system that allows users to feed personalized information into the system. This information can include preferences, special requests, real-time updates (e.g., delays), and any other relevant details. Triggers are generated based on this information, both from existing customer relationship management (CRM) data and real-time requests. These triggers enable touchpoints throughout the travel journey to prepare and provide a unique personalized travel experience.

### Information Generative Service

Hermes acts as a post-booking service, generating messages and understandable information to be sent to different touchpoints. It ensures that suppliers and service providers are well-informed about the customer's preferences, needs, and any special requirements. By creating portals for partners, Hermes encourages collaboration and enhances the overall intermodal travel experience. This service aims to reduce logistics, cater to Cathay's preferences, and provide a seamless travel experience for customers.

### UI/UX Fluidity

The user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of Hermes are designed to be fluid, ensuring ease of use and a seamless interaction with the platform. The UI/UX team focuses on providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface that enables customers to effortlessly navigate through the various features and functionalities of Hermes.

### API Integration

Hermes includes an API that allows integration with various third-party services and systems. This integration enables the platform to access relevant data and information from external sources, enhancing the overall travel experience and providing comprehensive solutions to customers.
